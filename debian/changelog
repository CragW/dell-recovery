dell-recovery (0.20) karmic; urgency=low

  * udev:
    - Add a udev rule so that devicekit-disks will hide Dell recovery
      partitions on factory shipped Linux systems.
  * recovery_frontend:
    - Add support for devicekit-disks.  If this fails, fall back to HAL.
  * debian/control:
    - Depends on devicekit-disks or hal for system detection.
    - Drop depends on python-glade2
  * Migrate from libglade to gtkbuilder.

dell-recovery (0.19) karmic; urgency=low

  * Add a manpage showing current usage.
  * COPYING:
    - Put a copy of the GPL2, not GPL3.
  * debian/control:
    - Set maintainer to have an @ubuntu.com
    - Add bzr info.
    - Set section more sanely to utils.
    - Set standards version to 3.8.1 (no changes necessary).
    - Add a Suggests for grub-pc.  The app works fine without it, but is
      more feature-filled with it installed.
  * debian/changelog:
    - Update to be GPL2, not GPL3.

dell-recovery (0.18) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Only fill in the UP or RP variables independently if they are 
    already empty.
  * Don't offer a retry dialog in the event a burning fails.  Some burners
    don't actually have reliable return codes.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 28 Apr 2009 14:46:34 -0500

dell-recovery (0.17) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Add support for command line arguments.
  * Update string indicating recovery is complete.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Fri, 10 Apr 2009 16:28:49 -0500

dell-recovery (0.16) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Add a COPYING file w/ license for when we start to make tarballs.
  * Add a CHANGES file (which is really just a symlink to debian/changelog)
  * Detect the filesystem of the rp.  A Linux RP is vfat.  Anything else
    means that it's not an RP. (Windows RP is ntfs-3g)

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Thu, 09 Apr 2009 17:55:03 -0500

dell-recovery (0.15) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Downgrade usb-creator to Recommends
  * Add brasero | nautilus-cd-burner to Recommends.
  * Add support for not using a burner.  If none of the burning software
    above was detected, then we'll just default to creating an ISO somewhere.
  * Touch the file we are creating before actually creating it from the dbus
    backend.  This makes the file owned by the first user who touched it (Us!)
    rather than root:root from the dbus backend.
  * Add optional support to use lsb-release to show information about 
    what release this ISO is being generated for.
  * Fix a GTKWarning about a separator setting that was getting ignored.
  * Add translation support to the .desktop file.
  * Drop first run note.  It wasn't working anyway.
  * Update translations from launchpad.
  * Add missing ${misc:Depends} to debian/control.
  * Update description in debian/control.
  * Add some artwork from dell-recovery directly to this package.
  * Remove explicitly hardcoded paths from .desktop file.
  * Explicitly set icon path in glade file instead.
  * Rename all translations from dell-recovery-LANG to LANG.  See launchpad answers
    #66257 for more information.
  * Merge in grub2 bootsplash stuff to this package.  We'll only show the bootsplash
    when the package is installed.  This rids us of the last dependency on dell-artwork.
  * Update 06_dell_theme to not use deprecated methods from grub2 anymore.

dell-recovery (0.14) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Rather than calling the backend with a gksudo wrapper,
    use policy kit to authorize it's call.
  * Call the backend via an async dbus call.  The method to do this
    was borrowed from Jockey as normal async calls were mixing up
    exceptions and what not.
  * Rename progress_dialogs.glade to the more appropriate 
    recovery_media_creator.glade.
  * Check for CD and USB burning applications when initializing the UI.  If a 
    particular type isn't found, then don't allow the application to run.
  * Add 99_dell_recovery (taken from china customizations) to the install.  This
    will prepare dell-recovery for when grub2 is made default.
  * Update 99_dell_recovery to match the string that we have for grub1

dell-recovery (0.13) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Don't enable or disable volume manager anymore.  Not necessary
    with the HAL FDI file we ship now.
  * Split up all activity between a frontend and backend script.  This
    allows the GUI to run without root priv's and the actual script to
    run with root priv's.

dell-recovery (0.12) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Cleanup an isolinux directory if it exists at the same
    time as a syslinux directory.
  * If the UP already exists, say if we are recovering from
    a recovery, no need to go and make it again.
  * Use brasero instead of nautilus-cd-burner since nautilus
    cd burner is no longer included in 9.04.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Mon, 23 Mar 2009 15:13:01 -0500

dell-recovery (0.11) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Don't build the MBR backup when creating recovery media.
    We'll dynamically create the partition table instead.
  * Don't gzip the UP.  We've plenty of space on the DVD media, so might as well
    speed up the process of backup and recovery.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 17 Mar 2009 11:46:34 -0500

dell-recovery (0.10) jaunty; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Drop dependency on menu.
  * debian/links:
    - Install actual .desktop file to /etc/skel rather than symlink.
  * import translations from launchpad.
  * Don't allow this tool to run on systems without a UP and RP.
    This is an undefined case that would likely fail anyway.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 03 Mar 2009 12:39:41 -0600

dell-recovery (0.9) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Update FDI file for changes in jaunty.

  * Move syslinux.cfg if it exists to isolinux.cfg.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 25 Nov 2008 02:16:47 -0600

dell-recovery (0.4) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Allow retrying failed burns.  This works around what appears to be either
    a GTK or nautilus-cd-burner bug where nautilus-cd-burner is crashing
    immediately.
  * Clean up some warnings on startup.
  * Remove old separators that were not necessary.
  * Add taskbar hints to all relevant dialogs.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Mon, 24 Nov 2008 12:58:58 -0600

dell-recovery (0.3) intrepid; urgency=low

  * New release.
    - Move syslinux to isolinux in case we want to recover from a recovery.
  * Filter out all .sys files in / so that there aren't errors later with
    usb-creator.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Wed, 05 Nov 2008 13:59:32 -0600

dell-recovery (0.2) intrepid; urgency=low

  * New release.
    - Adds USB Drive support
    - Adds a popup nag dialog
  * debian/control:
    - Bump standards version
    - Depend upon usb-creator for USB support.
