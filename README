Dell Recovery Media Creator
----
The Dell Recovery media creation tool supports two different modes, 
"End User Mode" and "Builder Mode".  In End User mode, the tool will simply 
create an image from an existing recovery partition with no customizations.
In builder mode, the tool allows modifying the source of the base image, 
the source of the framework, as well as injection of additional content.

End User Mode
---
When a customer receives a Dell machine that has been factory shipped 
with Linux, there will be an icon on the user's desktop to launch this 
tool.  They will only be asked what type of media they would like to create.

Builder Mode
---
In builder mode, the user will be offered a variety of options that allow them to create ISOs based upon different
snapshots of release upon standard Ubuntu media.

The latest information on how to use builder mode will be documented at:
