Dell Recovery Media Creator
----
The Dell Recovery media creation tool supports two different modes, 
"End User Mode" and "Builder Mode".  In End User mode, the tool will simply 
create an image from an existing recovery partition with no customizations.
In builder mode, the tool allows modifying the source of the base image, 
the source of the framework, as well as injection of additional content.

End User Mode
---
When a customer receives a Dell machine that has been factory shipped 
with Linux, there will be an icon on the user's desktop to launch this 
tool.  They will only be asked what type of media they would like to create.

Builder Mode
---
In builder mode, the user will be offered a variety of options that allow them to create ISOs based upon different
snapshots of release upon standard Ubuntu media.

The latest information on how to use builder mode will be documented at:

GIT Tree Tagging
---
It's important when working with the git trees that a few standards are used for this tool properly recognize.
All buildable points need to be identified with tags in this format:

VERSION_{X,A}NUMBER
or
VERSION_{X,A}NUMBER.ITERATION

VERSION is the OS version as determined by a flat file on the disk or by lsb_release
X is for development version
A is for stable version
NUMBER is an increasing number
ITERATION is the spinoff for FISH drivers

GIT Tree Branches
---
If subbranches are created for one off projects, the tool expects tip to be stable.  Please don't use tags
on these types of branches.
